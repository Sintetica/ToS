  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Agreement sets forth the Terms of Service (“Terms”) and Privacy Policy 
     (“Policy”) for the use of the Discord application (“App”). By installing, 
     authorizing, or using the App, you agree to comply with these Terms. 
     If you do not agree, you must discontinue use immediately.</p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility & Use of Service</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be at least 13 years old, or the minimum age of digital consent 
        in your jurisdiction, to use the App.</li>
    <li>You must have a valid Discord account in good standing.</li>
    <li>You agree not to use the App for unlawful activities, harassment, 
        spam, exploitation, or any action that violates Discord’s 
        <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> 
        and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank">Community Guidelines</a>.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access if you 
        violate these Terms or abuse the service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Service Availability & Modifications</h2>
  <p>The App is provided on an “as available” basis. We make no guarantees of 
     uninterrupted service or error-free operation. We may modify, suspend, 
     or discontinue the App at any time without prior notice.</p>

  <h2>4. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App may collect and temporarily process the following information 
     from Discord’s API:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Data:</strong> Discord user ID, username, and discriminator 
        (used to identify users).</li>
    <li><strong>Server Data:</strong> Guild ID, role information, and 
        configuration settings (used if the App manages roles or server settings).</li>
    <li><strong>Interaction Data:</strong> Slash commands, button clicks, 
        and similar events necessary for bot functionality.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No personal information such as real names, emails, or IP addresses 
     is collected directly by this App.</p>

  <h2>5. How Data is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To execute commands and provide App functionality.</li>
    <li>To verify linked roles or similar features, if enabled.</li>
    <li>For debugging and improving App reliability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Data is not sold, licensed, or shared with third parties. Data is only 
     processed to provide the service as described.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>Interaction data may be cached in memory while the App is running. 
     In some cases (such as linked roles), user IDs or server settings 
     may be stored in a database to preserve functionality across sessions.</p>
  <p>Data is retained only as long as necessary for the operation of the 
     App and will be deleted when no longer required.</p>

  <h2>7. User Rights & Control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may revoke the App’s access by removing it from your Discord account 
        or server at any time.</li>
    <li>You may request deletion of stored data associated with your Discord ID 
        by contacting us directly.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for reviewing Discord’s privacy settings and 
        permissions granted to the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>The App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any 
     kind, whether express or implied. We disclaim all liability for 
     interruptions, data loss, or damages arising from use of the App.</p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for 
     indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use 
     of the App. Our liability for any claim shall not exceed the amount 
     paid (if any) by you to use the App.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to this Agreement</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms and this Policy from time to time. Updated 
     versions will be posted publicly, and continued use of the App after 
     changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Agreement.</p>
