  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: August 16, 2025</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Discord application (“App”) collects, uses, and manages information. 
  By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App may receive certain data through Discord’s API when you interact with it. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Data:</strong> Discord user ID, username, and discriminator (for identification).</li>
    <li><strong>Server Data:</strong> Guild ID, server configuration, and role information (for features such as role management).</li>
    <li><strong>Interaction Data:</strong> Commands you invoke, button clicks, and similar activity needed for functionality.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect your real name, email, or IP address directly. Any such data is handled only by Discord, not this App.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide the functionality of the App, such as responding to commands or managing roles.</li>
    <li>To store configuration settings so features persist across sessions.</li>
    <li>To improve stability, monitor errors, and enhance the App over time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We never sell or rent your data. Data is used solely for the App’s functionality.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>Interaction data may be processed temporarily while the App is running. In some cases, 
  certain identifiers (such as user IDs or server settings) may be stored in a database 
  to enable persistent features. Data is retained only as long as necessary and is deleted 
  when no longer needed.</p>

  <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to third parties. The only data exchange 
  occurs between the App and Discord’s API, as required for the App to function.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect 
  information from such users. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child’s data 
  has been collected, please contact us to request its deletion.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data processed by the App. However, no system can 
  be guaranteed 100% secure, and we disclaim liability for unauthorized access beyond our control.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may remove the App from your Discord account or server at any time, which revokes its access.</li>
    <li>You may request deletion of data associated with your Discord user ID.</li>
    <li>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the method below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted publicly, 
  and continued use of the App after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
